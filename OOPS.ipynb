        "## Theoretical Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Answer:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which are instances of classes. It focuses on grouping data and functions that operate on that data into objects, promoting modularity, reusability, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Answer:** A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that represent the behavior of the objects created from the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Answer:** An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that encapsulates data and behavior as defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Answer:** Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data, restricting access to some of the object's components to protect the state of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Answer:** Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\" methods) are special methods in Python that have names beginning and ending with double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`). They allow you to define behavior for built-in operations such as object creation, string representation, and operator overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Answer:** Inheritance allows a class (called a derived or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a base or parent class). This promotes code reusability and a hierarchical classification of classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Answer:** Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways. It enables a unified interface to interact with objects of different types, typically through method overriding or operator overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Answer:** Encapsulation in Python is achieved by bundling data and methods within a class and restricting access to certain components using private (e.g., `__balance`) or protected attributes (e.g., `_value`). This prevents unintended interference with the object's state.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Answer:** A constructor is a special method (`__init__`) that is automatically called when an object is created. It initializes the object's attributes and sets up its initial state.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** Class methods are methods that take the class as the first argument (usually named `cls`) and can modify class state. They are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator. Static methods, defined with the `@staticmethod` decorator, do not take any implicit first argument and behave like regular functions that reside within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** Python does not support traditional method overloading (i.e., having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). Instead, you can use default parameters or variable-length arguments to achieve similar functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the superclass method.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** The property decorator (`@property`) in Python allows you to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes. It is used to encapsulate instance attributes and to add validation logic without changing the public interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enhances code flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability by enabling a single interface to work with different underlying forms (data types).\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and typically contains one or more abstract methods. Abstract methods are defined using the `@abstractmethod` decorator from the `abc` module and must be implemented by any concrete subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** Advantages of OOP include modularity, reusability, scalability, easy maintenance, and improved code organization. It models real-world entities more effectively and supports concepts like inheritance and polymorphism for more flexible code design.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** A class variable is shared by all instances of a class, while an instance variable is unique to each object. Class variables are defined within the class but outside any method, whereas instance variables are usually defined in the constructor (`__init__`).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** Multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows the subclass to combine behaviors and attributes from all its parents, though it requires careful management of method resolution order (MRO) to avoid ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** The `__str__` method is used to create a human-readable string representation of an object, while the `__repr__` method is intended to generate an “official” string representation that can be used to reproduce the object if possible. They help in debugging and logging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** The `super()` function is used to call methods from a parent class. It is commonly used in inheritance to ensure that the parent class is properly initialized or to extend its behavior without explicitly naming the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** The `__del__` method is a destructor called when an object is about to be destroyed. It can be used to perform cleanup actions such as closing files or releasing resources. However, its use is generally discouraged due to unpredictable behavior in garbage-collected environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. **What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** A `@staticmethod` does not take an implicit first parameter (neither `self` nor `cls`) and acts like a normal function defined within a class’s namespace. A `@classmethod` takes the class itself as the first parameter (usually called `cls`) and can access or modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** Polymorphism in Python is typically achieved through method overriding in an inheritance hierarchy. Different subclasses can implement their own version of the same method, allowing a single interface to invoke behavior that is specific to the type of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. **What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object consecutively. This is achieved by having each method return the object itself (`self`), allowing the next method to be called inline.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. **What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Answer:** The `__call__` method allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. When defined, calling the object (e.g., `obj()`) automatically invokes the `__call__` method."
